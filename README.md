*ABSTRACT:*
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a big reason for morbidity and mortality in the current living style. Identification of Cardiovascular disease is an important but a complex task that needs to be performed very minutely, efficiently and the correct automation would be very desirable. With the help of data science tools and machine learning algorithms, doctors can detect and track common conditions, like cancer, cardiac or respiratory diseases. Data Science technology can also detect the slightest changes in the patient’s health indicators and predict possible disorders. An automated system in medical diagnosis would enhance medical care and it can also reduce costs. In this study, we have designed a system that can efficiently discover the rules using dataset of major health factors from patients to predict the risk level of patients based on the given parameter about their health. The performance of the system is evaluated in terms of model prediction accuracy and the results show that the system has great potential in predicting the cardiovascular disease risk level more accurately.

PROBLEM DEFINITION:
CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. Clinical decisions are often made based on doctor’s experience and intuition rather and much cost that affect the medical services quality. Using analytic tools and data modeling can help in enhancing clinical decisions. Thus, the goal here is to build a web application to help doctors in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases.

THESIS MOTIVATION:
The main motivation of our thesis is to identify and cure the cardiovascular illness at the beginning stage itself, in order to reduce the morbidity and mortality rate. To produce a low cost and time-efficient tool to diagnose cardiovascular illness. It will create an awareness of a healthy lifestyle. It is a device to be aware of cardiovascular health. The main motto of our thesis is to produce exactly correct predicted values without any errors.

RESEARCH OBJECTIVE:
The main objective of this study is to take a step forward to reduce the mortality rate of patients with cardiovascular disease by providing all the essential precautions to diagnose. The proposed system diagnoses cardiovascular diseases by providing an effective and efficient Web app using Data Science Engineering. The objective of this study is to make the cardiovascular diagnosis process easy, less time-taking, and secure prediction. A web application for cardiovascular diagnostic systems to eliminate false predictions that can happen in traditional physician prediction schemes.

FEASIBLITY STUDY:
The use case we have been taken is a serious problem in the field of healthcare. The system we have discovered will create an evolution to stop the cardiovascular diagnosis problem. Further, we implemented the web app using the QR code scanning method. Anyone can use the cardiovascular diagnosis web app anytime and anywhere by simply scanning the implemented QR code. The system we designed will produce the results with 100% accuracy that was deployed with the Random Forest ML model.
